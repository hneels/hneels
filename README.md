### Hi, I'm Hope ðŸ‘‹
<hr>

I'm a grad student at Boston University, pursuing an MS in Software Development and a graduate certificate in Web Application Development. Before making the switch to software development, I was a staff director at a mental health & addiction treatment center, and I'm excited about the intersection of technology and mental health care. If you are too, let's connect! ![linkedin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66707636/177416455-964d44cb-bdba-48bc-aae7-2b8f3a87b4b7.svg)
